<!-- Chunk: docs/chunks/macos_app_bundle - macOS app bundle packaging

     Entitlements for LiteEdit code signing.

     Note: This app is NOT sandboxed because the terminal emulator requires
     PTY access which is incompatible with the App Sandbox. This means the
     app cannot be distributed via the Mac App Store (which requires sandboxing),
     but can be distributed via direct download with notarization.

         The terminal emulator uses PTY (pseudo-terminal) functionality which
         requires access to /dev/ptmx and related system resources. This is
