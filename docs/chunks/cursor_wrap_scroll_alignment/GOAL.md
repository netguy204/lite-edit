This comment describes schema information that needs to be adhered
to throughout the process.

STATUS VALUES:
- FUTURE: This chunk is queued for future work and not yet being implemented
- IMPLEMENTING: This chunk is in the process of being implemented.
- ACTIVE: This chunk accurately describes current or recently-merged work
- SUPERSEDED: Another chunk has modified the code this chunk governed
- HISTORICAL: Significant drift; kept for archaeology only

FUTURE CHUNK APPROVAL REQUIREMENT:
ALL FUTURE chunks require operator approval before committing or injecting.
After refining this GOAL.md, you MUST present it to the operator and wait for
explicit approval. Do NOT commit or inject until the operator approves.
This applies whether triggered by "in the background", "create a future chunk",
or any other mechanism that creates a FUTURE chunk.

COMMIT BOTH FILES: When committing a FUTURE chunk after approval, add the entire
chunk directory (both GOAL.md and PLAN.md) to the commit, not just GOAL.md. The
`ve chunk create` command creates both files, and leaving PLAN.md untracked will
cause merge conflicts when the orchestrator creates a worktree for the PLAN phase.

PARENT_CHUNK:
- null for new work
- chunk directory name (e.g., "006-segment-compaction") for corrections or modifications

CODE_PATHS:
- Populated at planning time
- List files you expect to create or modify
- Example: ["src/segment/writer.rs", "src/segment/format.rs"]

CODE_REFERENCES:
- Populated after implementation, before PR
- Uses symbolic references to identify code locations

- Format: {file_path}#{symbol_path} where symbol_path uses :: as nesting separator
- Example:
  code_references:
    - ref: src/segment/writer.rs#SegmentWriter
      implements: "Core write loop and buffer management"
    - ref: src/segment/writer.rs#SegmentWriter::fsync
      implements: "Durability guarantees"
    - ref: src/utils.py#validate_input
      implements: "Input validation logic"


NARRATIVE:
- If this chunk was derived from a narrative document, reference the narrative directory name.
- When setting this field during /chunk-create, also update the narrative's OVERVIEW.md
  frontmatter to add this chunk to its `chunks` array with the prompt and chunk_directory.
- If this is the final chunk of a narrative, the narrative status should be set to COMPLETED
  when this chunk is completed.

INVESTIGATION:
- If this chunk was derived from an investigation's proposed_chunks, reference the investigation
  directory name (e.g., "memory_leak" for docs/investigations/memory_leak/).
- This provides traceability from implementation work back to exploratory findings.
- When implementing, read the referenced investigation's OVERVIEW.md for context on findings,
  hypotheses tested, and decisions made during exploration.
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced investigations exist.


SUBSYSTEMS:
- Optional list of subsystem references that this chunk relates to
- Format: subsystem_id is the subsystem directory name, relationship is "implements" or "uses"
- "implements": This chunk directly implements part of the subsystem's functionality
- "uses": This chunk depends on or uses the subsystem's functionality
- Example:
  subsystems:
    - subsystem_id: "validation"
      relationship: implements
    - subsystem_id: "frontmatter"
      relationship: uses
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced subsystems exist
- When a chunk that implements a subsystem is completed, a reference should be added to
  that chunk in the subsystems OVERVIEW.md file front matter and relevant section.

FRICTION_ENTRIES:
- Optional list of friction entries that this chunk addresses
- Provides "why did we do this work?" traceability from implementation back to accumulated pain points
- Format: entry_id is the friction entry ID (e.g., "F001"), scope is "full" or "partial"
  - "full": This chunk fully resolves the friction entry
  - "partial": This chunk partially addresses the friction entry
- When to populate: During /chunk-create if this chunk addresses known friction from FRICTION.md
- Example:
  friction_entries:
    - entry_id: F001
      scope: full
    - entry_id: F003
      scope: partial
- Validated by `ve chunk validate` to ensure referenced friction entries exist in FRICTION.md
- When a chunk addresses friction entries and is completed, those entries are considered RESOLVED

BUG_TYPE:
- Optional field for bug fix chunks that guides agent behavior at completion
- Values: semantic | implementation | null (for non-bug chunks)
  - "semantic": The bug revealed new understanding of intended behavior
    - Code backreferences REQUIRED (the fix adds to code understanding)
    - On completion, search for other chunks that may need updating
    - Status → ACTIVE (the chunk asserts ongoing understanding)
  - "implementation": The bug corrected known-wrong code
    - Code backreferences MAY BE SKIPPED (they don't add semantic value)
    - Focus purely on the fix
    - Status → HISTORICAL (point-in-time correction, not an ongoing anchor)
- Leave null for feature chunks and other non-bug work

CHUNK ARTIFACTS:
- Single-use scripts, migration tools, or one-time utilities created for this chunk
  should be stored in the chunk directory (e.g., docs/chunks/foo/migrate.py)
- These artifacts help future archaeologists understand what the chunk did
- Unlike code in src/, chunk artifacts are not expected to be maintained long-term
- Examples: data migration scripts, one-time fixups, analysis tools used during implementation

CREATED_AFTER:
- Auto-populated by `ve chunk create` - DO NOT MODIFY manually
- Lists the "tips" of the chunk DAG at creation time (chunks with no dependents yet)
- Tips must be ACTIVE chunks (shipped work that has been merged)
- Example: created_after: ["auth_refactor", "api_cleanup"]

IMPORTANT - created_after is NOT implementation dependencies:
- created_after tracks CAUSAL ORDERING (what work existed when this chunk was created)
- It does NOT mean "chunks that must be implemented before this one can work"
- FUTURE chunks can NEVER be tips (they haven't shipped yet)

COMMON MISTAKE: Setting created_after to reference FUTURE chunks because they
represent design dependencies. This is WRONG. If chunk B conceptually depends on
chunk A's implementation, but A is still FUTURE, B's created_after should still
reference the current ACTIVE tips, not A.

WHERE TO TRACK IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES:
- Investigation proposed_chunks ordering (earlier = implement first)
- Narrative chunk sequencing in OVERVIEW.md
- Design documents describing the intended build order
- The `created_after` field will naturally reflect this once chunks ship

DEPENDS_ON:
- Declares explicit implementation dependencies that affect orchestrator scheduling
- Format: list of chunk directory name strings, or null
- Default: [] (empty list - explicitly no dependencies)

VALUE SEMANTICS (how the orchestrator interprets this field):

| Value             | Meaning                              | Oracle behavior   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `null` or omitted | "I don't know my dependencies"       | Consult oracle    |
| `[]` (empty list) | "I explicitly have no dependencies"  | Bypass oracle     |
| `["chunk_a"]`     | "I depend on these specific chunks"  | Bypass oracle     |

CRITICAL: The default `[]` means "I have analyzed this chunk and it has no dependencies."
This is an explicit assertion, not a placeholder. If you haven't analyzed dependencies yet,
change the value to `null` (or remove the field entirely) to trigger oracle consultation.

WHEN TO USE EACH VALUE:
- Use `[]` when you have analyzed the chunk and determined it has no implementation dependencies
  on other chunks in the same batch. This tells the orchestrator to skip conflict detection.
- Use `null` when you haven't analyzed dependencies yet and want the orchestrator's conflict
  oracle to determine if this chunk conflicts with others.
- Use `["chunk_a", "chunk_b"]` when you know specific chunks must complete before this one.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
The orchestrator's conflict oracle adds latency and cost to detect potential conflicts.
When you declare `[]`, you're asserting independence and enabling the orchestrator to
schedule immediately. When you declare `null`, you're requesting conflict analysis.

PURPOSE AND BEHAVIOR:
- When a list is provided (empty or not), the orchestrator uses it directly for scheduling
- When null, the orchestrator consults its conflict oracle to detect dependencies heuristically
- Dependencies express order within a single injection batch (intra-batch scheduling)
- The chunks listed in depends_on will be scheduled to complete before this chunk starts

CONTRAST WITH created_after:
- `created_after` tracks CAUSAL ORDERING (what work existed when this chunk was created)
- `depends_on` tracks IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES (what must complete before this chunk runs)
- `created_after` is auto-populated at creation time and should NOT be modified manually
- `depends_on` is agent-populated based on design requirements and may be edited

WHEN TO DECLARE EXPLICIT DEPENDENCIES:
- When you know chunk B requires chunk A's implementation to exist before B can work
- When the conflict oracle would otherwise miss a subtle dependency
- When you want to enforce a specific execution order within a batch injection
- When a narrative or investigation explicitly defines chunk sequencing

EXAMPLE:
  # Chunk has no dependencies (explicit assertion - bypasses oracle)
  depends_on: []

  # Chunk dependencies unknown (triggers oracle consultation)
  depends_on: null

  # Chunk B depends on chunk A completing first
  depends_on: ["auth_api"]

  # Chunk C depends on both A and B completing first
  depends_on: ["auth_api", "auth_client"]

VALIDATION:
- `null` is valid and triggers oracle consultation
- `[]` is valid and means "explicitly no dependencies" (bypasses oracle)
- Referenced chunks should exist in docs/chunks/ (warning if not found)
- Circular dependencies will be detected at injection time
- Dependencies on ACTIVE chunks are allowed (they've already completed)

# Chunk Goal

## Minor Goal

The cursor's vertical screen position is wrong—and variably so depending on how
far the viewport has been scrolled—whenever wrapped lines are present in the
document. The cursor may appear one or more rows above or below the text it
actually belongs to.

The root cause is a coordinate-space mismatch introduced in
`line_wrap_rendering`. `Viewport::first_visible_line()` derives the first
visible buffer line as `floor(scroll_offset_px / line_height)`, treating each
unit of scroll as exactly one buffer line. But `Viewport::ensure_visible_wrapped`
sets `scroll_offset_px` in *visual* (screen) row pixel space: it sums up the
screen rows occupied by each buffer line's wrapped output and sets
`scroll_offset_px = target_screen_row * line_height`. When wrapped buffer lines
are present, visual screen row N does not equal buffer line N. The two subsystems
speak different units, so `first_visible_line()` returns the wrong buffer line
index, and the render loop in `update_from_buffer_with_wrap` accumulates
`cumulative_screen_row` from the wrong starting point, placing the cursor quad
at the wrong Y position on screen.

This chunk fixes the mismatch so that the cursor always appears at the exact
pixel row of the character it occupies, regardless of scroll position or the
number of wrapped lines visible above it.

## Success Criteria

- The cursor's vertical position is stable and correct at all scroll positions.
  Scrolling a document that contains wrapped lines does not cause the cursor to
  drift up or down relative to the text it is on.
- `Viewport::ensure_visible_wrapped` sets `scroll_offset_px` such that
  `first_visible_line()` returns the correct buffer line index when wrapping is
  active. The two are always in the same coordinate space.
- The cursor rendering path in `GlyphBuffer::update_from_buffer_with_wrap`
  accumulates `cumulative_screen_row` from the correct baseline: the viewport's
  true first visible *buffer* line, not an incorrectly-derived approximation.
- No regression to any existing behaviour in the non-wrapped rendering path
  (`update_from_buffer_with_cursor`), viewport arithmetic, or scroll clamping.
- Tests covering at least the following scenarios:
  - Cursor on a line that does not wrap, with wrapped lines above it.
  - Cursor on the continuation row (second or later screen row) of a wrapped
    buffer line.
  - Cursor at the document start with no wrapped lines above.
  - `ensure_visible_wrapped` called when the cursor is below the viewport with
    wrapped lines above.

## Relationship to Parent

`line_wrap_rendering` introduced soft wrapping, `WrapLayout`, and
`ensure_visible_wrapped`. The scroll arithmetic in that chunk conflated visual
screen rows with buffer line indices when computing and applying `scroll_offset_px`,
which is what causes the cursor hot-position to be variable. The coordinate
mapping inside `WrapLayout` itself is correct; only the scroll-offset accounting
in `Viewport::ensure_visible_wrapped` and the baseline used by the cursor-quad
emit in `GlyphBuffer::update_from_buffer_with_wrap` need to be corrected.
