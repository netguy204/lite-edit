# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Core confirm dialog functionality implemented (widget, geometry, focus state, key handling) but two gaps remain: (1) Missing required EditorState integration tests for dirty close → dialog, confirm → close tab, cancel → keep tab, and (2) render_with_confirm_dialog() is a stub that doesn't actually render the dialog overlay despite ConfirmDialogGlyphBuffer being fully implemented.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs (tests module)

**Concern:** GOAL.md success criteria explicitly requires 'new unit tests for: EditorState integration (dialog opens on dirty close, confirm closes tab, cancel keeps tab)'. These tests are missing.

**Suggestion:** Add integration tests that verify: (1) close_tab on dirty tab sets focus to ConfirmDialog and populates confirm_dialog/pending_close, (2) handling Confirmed outcome closes the tab, (3) handling Cancelled outcome keeps the tab open

### Issue 2: crates/editor/src/renderer.rs:2252-2264

**Concern:** render_with_confirm_dialog() is a stub that ignores the dialog parameter. ConfirmDialogGlyphBuffer is fully implemented but not wired into rendering. Users see focus change but no visible dialog.

**Suggestion:** Wire up ConfirmDialogGlyphBuffer in the renderer similar to selector overlay rendering. The geometry calculation and buffer update code already exist in confirm_dialog.rs.
