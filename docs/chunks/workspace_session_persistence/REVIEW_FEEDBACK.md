# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

All 11 success criteria are satisfied with comprehensive implementation and unit tests. However, the integration test file specified in PLAN.md Step 11 and listed in code_paths (`crates/editor/tests/session_persistence.rs`) does not exist.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/tests/session_persistence.rs (does not exist)

**Concern:** PLAN.md Step 11 specifies creating an integration test file at this location, and it is listed in the chunk's code_paths frontmatter, but the file does not exist. The unit tests in session.rs are comprehensive, but the plan explicitly called for a separate integration test.

**Suggestion:** Either create the integration test as specified in PLAN.md Step 11, or update the PLAN.md Deviations section to document why it was omitted.
