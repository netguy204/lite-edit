# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

All core editing functionality implemented with excellent test coverage (104 tests passing). One gap: Cmd-A (select all) handling required by GOAL.md is missing - the implementation has Ctrl-A for Emacs-style line start but lacks macOS-standard Cmd-A.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/buffer_target.rs:52-100

**Concern:** GOAL.md requires 'Cmd-A → select all (selection state not required — just move cursor to start/end as a placeholder)'. Implementation has Ctrl-A for Emacs-style line start but lacks Cmd-A handling.

**Suggestion:** Add handler: Key::Char('a') if mods.command && !mods.control => Some(Command::MoveToBufferEnd) as placeholder, or implement proper SelectAll command.
