**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

All core editing functionality implemented except Cmd-A (select all) handler required by GOAL.md. 15 of 16 success criteria satisfied; one functional gap needs resolution.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/buffer_target.rs:52-100

**Concern:** GOAL.md explicitly requires 'Cmd-A → select all (selection state not required for this chunk — just move cursor to start/end as a placeholder)'. The implementation has Ctrl-A for Emacs-style line start but lacks Cmd-A handling entirely.

**Suggestion:** Add a handler for Key::Char('a') if mods.command && !mods.control that maps to a SelectAll or MoveToBufferEnd command as placeholder behavior.
