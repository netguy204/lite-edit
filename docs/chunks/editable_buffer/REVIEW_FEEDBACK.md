# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 2
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

15 of 16 success criteria satisfied. One functional gap: Cmd-A (select all) is not implemented despite being explicitly required in GOAL.md. This was flagged in iteration 1 and remains unaddressed in iteration 2.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/buffer_target.rs:52-100

**Concern:** Cmd-A (select all) is not implemented. GOAL.md explicitly requires 'Cmd-A → select all (selection state not required for this chunk — just move cursor to start/end as a placeholder)'. This was flagged in iteration 1 and remains unaddressed.

**Suggestion:** Add handler for Key::Char('a') if mods.command && !mods.control that maps to MoveToBufferEnd as a placeholder. Example: Key::Char('a') if mods.command && !mods.control => Some(Command::MoveToBufferEnd)
