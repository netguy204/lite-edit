# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Implementation satisfies all 10 success criteria for soft line wrapping, but is missing the integration tests specified in PLAN.md Step 10. The WrapLayout arithmetic, glyph buffer rendering, cursor/selection handling, hit-testing, and viewport scrolling are all correctly implemented with comprehensive unit tests. One functional gap: crates/editor/tests/wrap_test.rs does not exist.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/tests/wrap_test.rs (missing)

**Concern:** PLAN.md Step 10 specifies creating integration tests in crates/editor/tests/wrap_test.rs covering: (1) cursor at wrap boundary, (2) selection across wrap boundary, (3) click on continuation row, (4) no horizontal scroll, (5) continuation row visual indicator. The file does not exist and these specific integration tests are absent.

**Suggestion:** Create crates/editor/tests/wrap_test.rs with integration tests that exercise the wrap-aware rendering and hit-testing through the public APIs.
