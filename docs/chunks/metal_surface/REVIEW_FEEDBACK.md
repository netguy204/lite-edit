# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 2
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

All 7 success criteria satisfied. Implementation correctly builds and runs with Metal rendering via CAMetalLayer. However, previous feedback (iteration 1) about duplicate source files in root src/ directory was not addressed - these dead code files should be removed.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: src/main.rs, src/metal_view.rs, src/renderer.rs

**Concern:** Duplicate source files not removed despite being flagged in iteration 1. Root src/ contains identical copies of crates/editor/src/ files. Dead code that could cause confusion.

**Suggestion:** Remove the three duplicate files in src/. Canonical implementation is in crates/editor/src/.
