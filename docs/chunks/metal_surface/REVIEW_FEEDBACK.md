# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Implementation satisfies all core Metal rendering criteria - builds successfully, tests pass, and all 7 success criteria are met. One style issue: duplicate files exist in root src/ directory alongside crates/editor/src/.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: src/main.rs, src/metal_view.rs, src/renderer.rs

**Concern:** Root src/ directory contains identical copies of crates/editor/src/ files. These are dead code not referenced by workspace Cargo.toml, could cause confusion and divergence

**Suggestion:** Remove duplicate files in src/ directory. Canonical implementation lives in crates/editor/src/
