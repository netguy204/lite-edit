# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Data model and keyboard/mouse navigation implemented correctly, but left rail rendering is not integrated into the Metal render pipeline - the LeftRailGlyphBuffer is built but never drawn.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/renderer.rs

**Concern:** LeftRailGlyphBuffer exists but Renderer never instantiates, updates, or draws it. PLAN.md Steps 11-12 not implemented.

**Suggestion:** Add LeftRailGlyphBuffer field to Renderer, update it in render(), draw its phases with appropriate colors.

### Issue 2: crates/editor/src/glyph_buffer.rs

**Concern:** Content area rendering not offset by RAIL_WIDTH. Main editor content will overlap with where the left rail should be.

**Suggestion:** Add x_offset parameter to update_from_buffer_with_wrap() or handle via shader uniforms.
