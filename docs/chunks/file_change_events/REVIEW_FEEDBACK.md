# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 2
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Prior feedback not addressed: EventSender still not propagated from EditorState to Editor, so workspaces never receive file change callbacks. All infrastructure is in place (EditorEvent::FileChanged, EventSender::send_file_changed, FileIndex::start_with_callback, debouncing, self-write suppression) but the wiring is broken because EditorState::set_event_sender() does not call self.editor.set_event_sender().

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:443-445

**Concern:** EditorState::set_event_sender() stores the event sender only on EditorState.event_sender (for PTY wakeups) but does NOT propagate to self.editor.set_event_sender(). As a result, Editor.event_sender is always None, and all workspaces are created via FileIndex::start() (without callback) instead of FileIndex::start_with_callback(). This is a recurring issue from iteration 1.

**Suggestion:** Add self.editor.set_event_sender(sender.clone()); to EditorState::set_event_sender() to ensure Editor.event_sender is set, enabling file change callbacks for workspaces.
