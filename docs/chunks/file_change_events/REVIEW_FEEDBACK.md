# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Core infrastructure is correct but EventSender is not propagated to Editor, so workspaces never receive file change callbacks

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:443-445

**Concern:** EditorState::set_event_sender() does not call self.editor.set_event_sender(). Editor::event_sender is always None, so all workspaces are created via FileIndex::start() without callback.

**Suggestion:** Add self.editor.set_event_sender(sender.clone()); to EditorState::set_event_sender()
