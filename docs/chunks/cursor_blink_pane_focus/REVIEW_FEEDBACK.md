## Summary

Core multi-pane cursor visibility works, but unfocused panes hide cursor completely rather than showing a static cursor as specified in GOAL.md

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/renderer.rs:1600-1602

**Concern:** The implementation hides the cursor entirely in unfocused panes, but GOAL.md specifies unfocused panes should 'display a static cursor (visible but not blinking)'

**Suggestion:** Change the logic to pass `true` (always visible) for unfocused panes instead of `false`. For example: `let pane_cursor_visible = if is_focused { self.cursor_visible } else { true };` Alternatively, if hiding the cursor in unfocused panes is the intended design, update GOAL.md to reflect this behavior.
