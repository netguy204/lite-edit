# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 3
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

9 of 10 success criteria satisfied. Iteration 2 issue fixed (unread badge clearing), but Cmd+T shortcut for new tab creation remains missing after 3 review iterations. This is a documented success criterion from GOAL.md that has not been addressed.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:260-330

**Concern:** The Cmd+T shortcut for creating a new empty tab remains unimplemented. This was flagged in iterations 1 and 2 and persists in iteration 3. PLAN.md Step 6 explicitly requires 'Cmd+T: Create new empty tab in current workspace'. This is a documented success criterion that has not been addressed.

**Suggestion:** Add a Key::Char('t') handler in the Cmd+modifiers block (around line 286) that calls a new new_tab() method. Implementation should: (1) generate a tab ID via self.editor.gen_tab_id(), (2) create an empty file tab via Tab::empty_file(id, line_height), (3) add to workspace via workspace.add_tab(tab), (4) mark dirty region for re-render, (5) auto-scroll to ensure new tab is visible.
