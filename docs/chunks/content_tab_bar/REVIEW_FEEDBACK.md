# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 2
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Core tab bar functionality is solid but Cmd+T shortcut (new tab) and unread badge clearing on tab switch are still not implemented from iteration 1 feedback.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:260-330

**Concern:** Cmd+T shortcut for creating new tabs is not implemented. This was flagged in iteration 1 and remains unaddressed. PLAN.md Step 6 explicitly requires this shortcut.

**Suggestion:** Add a Key::Char('t') handler in the command modifier section (around line 286) that calls a new new_empty_tab() method. The method should generate a tab ID, create an empty file tab, add it to the workspace, and mark dirty.

### Issue 2: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:1027-1036

**Concern:** When switching to a tab, the unread flag is not cleared. This was flagged in iteration 1 and remains unaddressed. PLAN.md Step 8 explicitly states 'When switching tabs, call clear_unread() on the newly active tab.'

**Suggestion:** In switch_tab(), after calling workspace.switch_tab(index), add: if let Some(tab) = workspace.tabs.get_mut(index) { tab.unread = false; }
