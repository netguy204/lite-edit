# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Most tab bar functionality implemented well, but Cmd+T shortcut for creating new tabs is missing and unread badge clear on tab switch is not implemented.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:260-330

**Concern:** Cmd+T shortcut for creating new tabs is not implemented despite being specified in PLAN.md Step 6

**Suggestion:** Add Key::Char('t') handler with command modifier that creates an empty tab via a new_tab() method

### Issue 2: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:1027-1036

**Concern:** Unread badge not cleared when switching to a tab, as specified in PLAN.md Step 8

**Suggestion:** In switch_tab(), set workspace.tabs[index].unread = false after changing active tab
