# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Implementation meets core success criteria for background colors and glyph rendering, but two integration tests for box-drawing characters fail due to incorrect printf invocation (macOS /usr/bin/printf doesn't support \\u escapes).

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/terminal/tests/integration.rs:883

**Concern:** test_box_drawing_characters_captured uses \u escape sequences in printf args, but macOS /usr/bin/printf does not interpret \u escapes (outputs literal 'u250C' instead of Unicode character)

**Suggestion:** Either use $'...' syntax with bash, or use printf with actual UTF-8 bytes via Rust's format!() to construct the command, or use echo -e with UTF-8 string literals

### Issue 2: crates/terminal/tests/integration.rs:930

**Concern:** test_block_element_characters_captured has the same \u escape issue - macOS printf outputs literal text instead of Unicode characters

**Suggestion:** Same fix as test_box_drawing_characters_captured - use UTF-8 literals or bash $'...' syntax
