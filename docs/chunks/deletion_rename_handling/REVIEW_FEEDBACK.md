# Review Feedback

**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

All success criteria satisfied except one: clicking "Abandon" button for a deleted file does not close the tab as required by the success criteria.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:1335-1337

**Concern:** The success criteria states 'If the user chooses Abandon, the tab is closed', but when ConfirmOutcome::Cancelled is returned (user clicked Abandon), close_confirm_dialog() is called which only closes the dialog without closing the tab. The FileDeletedFromDisk context containing pane_id and tab_idx is discarded without acting on it.

**Suggestion:** Add special handling for FileDeletedFromDisk in the cancelled/abandon path. Create a handle_confirm_dialog_cancelled() method that checks the context type. For FileDeletedFromDisk, extract pane_id and tab_idx and call force_close_tab() before clearing the context. For other context types like CloseDirtyTab, keep existing behavior (just close dialog).
