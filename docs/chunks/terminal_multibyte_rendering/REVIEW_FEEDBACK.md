# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 2
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

All functional success criteria are satisfied. The previous review issue (wrap path not updated) has been fully addressed. One minor documentation issue remains: the PLAN.md Deviations section still contains a placeholder comment, and the checkmark investigation (Step 7) was not documented.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: docs/chunks/terminal_multibyte_rendering/PLAN.md:176-178

**Concern:** The Deviations section still contains the placeholder comment. Step 7 of the plan mentions identifying the checkmark character but no conclusion was documented.

**Suggestion:** Either document the checkmark codepoint if identified, or note explicitly that the fix addresses it generically without identifying the specific character.
