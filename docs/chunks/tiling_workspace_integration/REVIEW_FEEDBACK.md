## Summary

Pane tree integration is complete with one significant gap: mouse coordinate refactoring was NOT implemented — the old ad-hoc coordinate pipeline remains in handle_mouse().

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:1233-1280, crates/editor/src/buffer_target.rs:579-619

**Concern:** The GOAL.md explicitly requires refactoring mouse coordinate handling to flip y once at entry and use PaneRect for hit-testing. This was NOT implemented. The old ad-hoc coordinate pipeline remains.

**Suggestion:** Implement coordinate refactoring as specified in PLAN.md Steps 11-15: (1) Flip y at entry of handle_mouse(), (2) Use PaneRect for hit-testing, (3) Compute pane-local coords at dispatch, (4) Remove internal y-flip from pixel_to_buffer_position.
