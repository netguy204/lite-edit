# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 2
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Mouse coordinate refactoring (criteria 14-19) remains unimplemented from iteration 1 feedback; all other criteria satisfied.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:1233-1280, crates/editor/src/buffer_target.rs:579-632

**Concern:** The GOAL.md explicitly requires refactoring mouse coordinate handling to 'flip y once at entry' and use PaneRect for hit-testing. This was flagged in iteration 1 and has NOT been addressed. The old ad-hoc coordinate pipeline remains unchanged: each handler does its own y-flip, RAIL_WIDTH subtraction, etc. This blocks multi-pane mouse support and perpetuates the fragile coordinate transform patterns that the investigation documented (7+ bug-fix chunks from ad-hoc transforms).

**Suggestion:** Implement the coordinate refactoring as specified in PLAN.md Steps 11-15: (1) Flip y at entry point of handle_mouse(), (2) Use PaneRect for hit-testing, (3) Compute pane-local coordinates at dispatch point, (4) Remove internal y-flip from pixel_to_buffer_position and pixel_to_buffer_position_wrapped.
