# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 2
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Iteration 1 feedback not addressed: stop() still uses SIGKILL directly instead of SIGTERM→wait→SIGKILL. 14 of 15 success criteria are satisfied. The single gap is in stop() which sends SIGKILL directly via terminal.kill() instead of the graceful SIGTERM→wait→SIGKILL pattern specified in GOAL.md and PLAN.md. This was flagged in iteration 1 but remains unchanged.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/terminal/src/agent.rs:449-464

**Concern:** stop() sends SIGKILL directly instead of SIGTERM→wait→SIGKILL as specified in GOAL.md ('Stopping a running agent sends SIGTERM') and PLAN.md step 4. This prevents graceful agent shutdown.

**Suggestion:** Add nix crate, get PID from child handle, send SIGTERM first, wait 100ms polling try_wait(), then SIGKILL if needed. Use exit code -15 for SIGTERM, -9 for SIGKILL.
