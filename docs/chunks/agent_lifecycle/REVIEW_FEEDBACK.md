# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

All success criteria satisfied except one: the stop() method uses SIGKILL directly instead of the SIGTERM→wait→SIGKILL pattern specified in GOAL.md. 14 of 15 criteria pass; this functional deviation should be addressed before approval.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/terminal/src/agent.rs:449-464

**Concern:** stop() sends SIGKILL directly instead of SIGTERM→wait→SIGKILL as specified in GOAL.md and PLAN.md

**Suggestion:** Add nix crate dependency, send SIGTERM first, wait 100ms with polling, then SIGKILL if needed
