# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Core injection infrastructure implemented correctly, but missing the integration tests specified in the plan (Steps 10-12).

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/syntax/src/highlighter.rs#tests

**Concern:** The PLAN.md (Step 10) specifies integration tests including test_markdown_rust_code_block_highlighting(), test_markdown_multiple_code_blocks(), test_markdown_code_block_edit(), and test_markdown_add_code_block(). These tests are not present in the implementation.

**Suggestion:** Add the specified integration tests to validate Markdown fenced code block highlighting end-to-end as outlined in the plan.

### Issue 2: crates/syntax/src/highlighter.rs#tests

**Concern:** The PLAN.md (Step 11) specifies integration tests including test_html_script_tag_highlighting(), test_html_style_tag_highlighting(), and test_html_inline_js_edit(). These tests are not present.

**Suggestion:** Add the specified HTML injection tests as outlined in the plan.

### Issue 3: crates/syntax/src/highlighter.rs#tests

**Concern:** The PLAN.md (Step 12) specifies a test_injection_highlighting_performance() test that creates a Markdown file with 10 Rust code blocks and verifies viewport highlighting stays under 1ms. This test is not present.

**Suggestion:** Add the specified injection-specific performance benchmark to validate the <1ms performance target with injection-heavy files.
