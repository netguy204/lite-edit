# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Implementation is correct but missing the multi-pane unit test specified in PLAN.md Step 6 that validates the core new functionality of pane-aware file drop routing

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs (test module)

**Concern:** PLAN.md Step 6 specifies test_file_drop_targets_pane_under_cursor as a required test to verify the core new functionality of this chunk (multi-pane routing). This test is missing. Without it, there's no automated verification that dropping on a non-active pane routes the file path to that pane.

**Suggestion:** Add a test that creates a horizontal split (file buffer left, terminal right), drops at coordinates within the right pane, and verifies the path goes to the terminal even though the left pane may be active. The existing create_vertical_split_state() helper can be used as a template.
