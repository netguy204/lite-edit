# Review Feedback

**Iteration:** 1
**Decision:** FEEDBACK

## Summary

Core syntax crate is complete and well-tested (SyntaxHighlighter, SyntaxTheme, LanguageRegistry all work with 60 passing tests), but the wiring to the editor is incomplete — the highlighter is never instantiated on file open, incremental edits are not wired to key handlers, HighlightedBufferView is not used in the render path, and the module is not declared in main.rs.

## Issues to Address

### Issue 1: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs:1795

**Concern:** associate_file() never instantiates SyntaxHighlighter on file open

**Suggestion:** Extract extension, query LanguageRegistry, create highlighter if language found, store in tab.highlighter

### Issue 2: crates/editor/src/editor_state.rs (key handlers)

**Concern:** Buffer mutations do not call SyntaxHighlighter::edit()

**Suggestion:** After each buffer mutation, compute EditEvent and call highlighter.edit()

### Issue 3: crates/editor/src/glyph_buffer.rs

**Concern:** HighlightedBufferView wrapper exists but is never used in render path

**Suggestion:** Wrap TextBuffer with HighlightedBufferView when rendering file buffers

### Issue 4: crates/editor/src/main.rs

**Concern:** highlighted_buffer.rs not declared as module

**Suggestion:** Add mod highlighted_buffer; to main.rs

### Issue 5: crates/editor/tests/

**Concern:** Integration tests from PLAN Step 11 not implemented

**Suggestion:** Add syntax_highlighting.rs integration tests
